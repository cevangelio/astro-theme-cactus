		<p>
			This is a slow blog.

			It tracks a quiet journey toward financial independence — not through hype or hacks, but through patience and discipline.
			No crypto. No trading signals. No overnight success stories.
		</p>
		<p>Just a consistent weekly snapshot of a boring but resilient portfolio made up of:</p>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc" role="list">
			<li>ETFs (because markets grow over time)</li>
			<li>SRS (because taxes are real)</li>
			<li>Tech stocks (because it's 2025)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Every Saturday morning, the cactus gets watered — a new post, a new chart, small growth.
		</p>
		<p>Why a cactus?
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc" role="list">
			<li>Because it thrives in tough conditions.</li>
			<li>Because it doesn’t need attention every day.</li>
			<li>Because slow is not weak — it's wise.</li>
